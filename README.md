# LEO_Mobility_NS-3

This module is based on ns-3.29.

There are two directories:
One is scratch/, which contains test cases of various LEO satellite constellations, including iridium, oneweb, startlink, etc., as well as those using the new segmented routing algorithm.
The other is src/mobility/, which only adds a few files to the source directory.


To use it, simply replace the file directory with Src / mobility and recompile it.
